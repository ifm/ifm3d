# Migration Guide V1.2.0

## Changes to ifm3d::json
Note: The following only applies to the C++ interface, for python no changes are needed.

We have been delivering a copy of [nlohmann::json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) with ifm3d as part of the `device` module, this allowed users to easily and conveniently access the json formatted data without having to worry about parsing the output manually. 

However this approach lead to problems when users already were using `nlohmann::json` in their codebases and tried to integrate ifm3d.

To solve this problem we completely moved the implementation to the ifm3d namespace so our version doesn't interfere with any user supplied json library. 

Migration should be fairly easy, just fully qually the namespace, e.g.:
```C++
json j = o3r->Get();
```
becomes:
```C++
ifm3d::json j = o3r->Get();
```

Additionally to use the user-defined string literals `operator""_json` and `operator""_json_pointer` they have to be imported from the namespace

```C++
using namespace ifm3d::literals;
ifm3d::json j = "[1,2,3]"_json;
```

For details on using ifm3d::json and nlohmann::json together please take a look at the C++ documentation for ifm3d::json.
