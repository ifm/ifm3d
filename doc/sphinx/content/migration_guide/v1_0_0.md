# Migration Guide V1.0.0
The main change in version 1.0.x of ifm3d is in the definition of the objects, the `Camera`, the `FrameGrabber` and the `STLImage` buffer and the way to receive data.

## `Camera` (now `Device`)
The `Camera` object (and children `O3RCamera`, `O3DCamera` and `O3XCamera`), which handles the connection to the device and the configuration, remains unchanged in its concept and use. 
The names are changed to the following:  
| Name in ifm3d 0.93.0 and below | Name in ifm3d 1.0.x and above |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `CameraBase`                   | `Device`                      |
| `CameraO3X`                    | `O3X`                         |
| `CameraO3D`                    | `O3D`                         |
| `CameraO3R`                    | `O3R`                         |

## `FrameGrabber` and `STLImage` buffer

The instantiation of the `FrameGrabber` object is changed to remove the schema, which let you select which image to receive, from the constructor. The schema functionality is now part of the `Start` function (see below).
The way the frames are retrieved from the device is also different.
The image buffers (`STLImage` or the deprecated `Image` and `OpenCV` modules) are removed in order to simplify the access to the data.

We detail below the new functions available for receiving and processing data.
For each of these, we assume you have defined a `Device` (here the `O3R`) and a `FrameGrabber` object:

:::::{tabs}
::::{group-tab} C++
:::cpp
auto o3r = std::make_shared<ifm3d::O3R>();
auto fg = std::make_shared<ifm3d::FrameGrabber>(o3r, DEFAULT_PCIC_PORT);
:::
::::
::::{group-tab} Python
:::python
o3r = O3R()
fg = FrameGrabber(cam, DEFAULT_PCIC_PORT)
:::
::::
:::::
### Start streaming data with `Start`
The `Start` function starts the streaming process. The FrameGrabber will receive every frame, and a callback function, if defined, is called upon reception of the frame (see below).

:::::{tabs}
::::{group-tab} C++
:::cpp
fg->Start();
:::
::::
::::{group-tab} Python
:::python
fg.start()
:::
::::
:::::

To limit the bandwidth, one can choose to only receive a specific subset of images. This is specified in the call to the `Start` function. For instance, to receive only the distance and the amplitude image, use:

:::::{tabs}
::::{group-tab} C++
:::cpp
fg->Start(
    ifm3d::buffer_id::RADIAL_DISTANCE, 
    ifm3d::buffer_id::AMPLITUDE
    );
:::
::::
::::{group-tab} Python
:::python
fg.start([
  ifm3dpy.buffer_id.RADIAL_DISTANCE, 
  ifm3dpy.buffer_id.AMPLITUDE,
])
:::
::::
::::: 

The list of available images and internal parameters (intrinsic calibration, temperature, etc) is available in through the `buffer_id` object. Find more details in the [API documentation](https://ifm3d.com/sphinx-doc/build/html/ifm3d/doc/sphinx/index.html), for C++ or Python.

### Register a callback with `OnNewFrame`
The new function `OnNewFrame` allows you to register an action that will be performed every time a frame is received.

:::::{tabs}
::::{group-tab} C++
:::cpp
void Callback(ifm3d::Frame::Ptr frame){
  //Do something with the data
}
...
fg->OnNewFrame(&Callback);
:::
::::
::::{group-tab} Python
:::python
def callback(frame):
    # Do something with frame
    pass

fg.on_new_frame(callback)
:::
::::
:::::

>Note that the callback function is executed **for every frame** received from the device after the `Start()` function and until the `Stop()` function is called.
### Receive a frame - polling with `WaitForFrame`
The `WaitForFrame` function is similar to the previous function of the same name. 
It is intended to be called punctually to receive the first frame available, especially when using the software trigger (coming soon for the O3R platform). 
> Note: For performance reasons, we do not recommend using this function in an endless loop. Use the `OnNewFrame` function to register a callback that will be performed on every frame.

:::::{tabs}
::::{group-tab} C++
:::cpp
auto frame = fg->WaitForFrame().get();
:::
::::
::::{group-tab} Python
:::python
frame = fg.wait_for_frame().wait() # wait without timeout
# OR
[ok, frame] = fg.wait_for_frame().wait_for(500) # wait with 500ms timeout
# OR
frame = await fg.wait_for_frame() # using asyncio
:::
::::
:::::

> Note that to use coroutines in Python, you need to use the `asyncio` library (see [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html)). For instance, use:
> ``` python
> import asyncio
> async def main():
>    frame = await fg.wait_for_frame()
>    # do something with frame
> asyncio.run(main())
>```

The `WaitForFrame` function implicitly calls the `Start` function (see above). If nothing is specified, the default set of images is sent from the VPU. 
To specify which images to receive when using the `WaitForFrame` method, one has to call the `Start` function first, inputting the list of images to stream.

## Access the data
The way to access data, previously handled by the image buffers, has changed with ifm3d 1.0.x.
Instead of providing specific functions for each type of data, we use `frames` and the `GetBuffer` function, along with the `ifm3d::buffer_id` corresponding to the desired image. 
For instance, to get the distance and the point cloud, use:

:::::{tabs}
::::{group-tab} C++
:::cpp
auto distance = frame->GetBuffer(ifm3d::buffer_id::RADIAL_DISTANCE);
auto xyz = frame->GetBuffer(ifm3d::buffer_id::XYZ);
:::
::::
::::{group-tab} Python
:::python
distance = frame.get_buffer(ifm3d.buffer_id.RADIAL_DISTANCE)
xyz = frame.get_buffer(ifm3d.buffer_id.XYZ)
:::
::::
:::::

For the 2D RGB image in compressed JPEG format, you can use:

:::::{tabs}
::::{group-tab} C++
:::cpp
auto jpeg = frame->GetBuffer(ifm3d::buffer_id::JPEG);
:::
::::
::::{group-tab} Python
:::python
jpeg = frame.get_buffer(ifm3d.buffer_id.JPEG)
:::
::::
:::::
