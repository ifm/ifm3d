# Main changes
The main change in version 1.1.0 of ifm3d is the corrected order of the coordinates in the O3R XYZ_IMAGE buffer and the renamed O3R_DISTANCE_IMAGE_INFO and O3R_RGB_IMAGE_INFO to be in line with the ids reported by the device.


## XYZ_IMAGE coordinates
In v1.0.0 the coordinates in the buffer were actually in ZXY order, this has been corrected to now be in XYZ order.

## Renamed buffer_ids
The following buffer_ids have been renamed:
:::
O3R_DISTANCE_IMAGE_INFO -> TOF_INFO
O3R_RGB_IMAGE_INFO -> RGB_INFO
:::
This change has been made so the buffer_ids align with the buffer_ids reported by the device in `availablePCICOutput`.

The old buffered_ids are marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
