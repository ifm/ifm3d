# Migration Guide V1.1.0
The main change in version 1.1.0 of ifm3d is the corrected order of the coordinates in the O3R XYZ_IMAGE buffer and the renamed O3R_DISTANCE_IMAGE_INFO and O3R_RGB_IMAGE_INFO to be in line with the ids reported by the device.


## XYZ_IMAGE coordinates
In v1.0.0 the coordinates in the buffer were actually in ZXY order, this has been corrected to now be in XYZ order.

## Renamed `buffer_ids`
The following `buffer_ids` have been renamed:
:::
O3R_DISTANCE_IMAGE_INFO -> TOF_INFO
O3R_RGB_IMAGE_INFO -> RGB_INFO
:::
This change has been made so the `buffer_ids` align with the `buffer_ids` reported by the device in `availablePCICOutput`.

The old `buffer_ids` are marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

## API Interface changes
`Framgrabber::Stop()` now returns a `std::future<void>` (`Awaitable` in Python) which completes once the shutdown is complete.
Note that when calling Stop() inside a callback function waiting for shutdown will result in a deadlock as the FrameGrabber cannot finish until the callback is completed.
