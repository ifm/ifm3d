# Buffer types

`ifm3d` supports multiple device familes (O3R, O3D3xx, O3X1xx).

Each device natively provides different types of data, and the `ifm3d` library adds additional buffers for convenience.

The tables below list all available buffer types and which device they apply to. 
We also specify if the data is provided directly by the device, meaning it is streamed from the embedded device, or calculated by `ifm3d` API on the receiver device. 
This is important information to be considered when trying to work around bandwidth limitations and delays.

In this tables, the NA abbreviation stands for "Not Applicable."

### `DIAGNOSTIC` buffer

This buffer provides diagnostic information such as temperature, frame duration and framerate.

To unpack the information in the `DIAGNOSTIC` buffer, use the following structure:


| Content                                                                                                             | Type                    | Size    |

| Frontend Temperature 1                                                                                              | 32-bit signed int       | 4 bytes |
| Frontend Temperature 2                                                                                              | 32-bit signed int       | 4 bytes |
| i.mx6 Temperature                                                                                                   | 32-bit signed int       | 4 bytes |
| Frame duration: time between the last trigger and the readiness for a new trigger. Only relevant in triggered mode. | 32-bit unsigned integer | 4 bytes |
| Framerate. Only relevant in continuous mode (also called free running mode).                                        | 32-bit unsigned integer | 4 bytes |

:::{note}
All the temperatures are displayed in 0.1 °C.
Invalid temperatures have the value 0x7FFF (32767).
Some temperatures are only measured for specific part numbers, which might be why they are invalid.

In Python, the `DIAGNOSTIC` data can be unpacked with:

```python
# Necessary imports
import struct
import time
from ifm3dpy.device import O3D
from ifm3dpy.framegrabber import FrameGrabber, buffer_id

# Create the objects
o3d = O3D() #EDIT here when using a non-default IP address
fg = FrameGrabber(o3d)

#Collect a frame
fg.start([buffer_id.DIAGNOSTIC,])
time.sleep(5) # Grace period after initialization of the data stream
[ok, frame] = fg.wait_for_frame().wait_for(500)

# Get the data from the collected frame 
data = frame.get_buffer(buffer_id.DIAGNOSTIC)
# Unpack the data 
unpacked_data = struct.unpack('<4i2I', data)

fg.stop()
```

## Data formats

`ifm3d` supports multiple devices. These devices support multiple buffers and data types which can have different data formats on different devices.

We recommend to retrieve the format of a specific `buffer_id` programmatically.
One can use the code below (adapt to the specific `buffer_id`):
:::::{tabs}
::::{group-tab} C++

```cpp
ifm3d::Buffer xyz = frame->GetBuffer(ifm3d::buffer_id::XYZ);

// Query the data format and channel.
std::cout << xyz.nchannels() << std::endl;
std::cout << static_cast<int>(xyz.dataFormat()) << std::endl;
```

::::
::::{group-tab} Python

```python
print(type(frame.get_buffer(buffer_id.XYZ)))
print(np.shape(frame.get_buffer(buffer_id.XYZ)))
print(frame.get_buffer(buffer_id.RADIAL_DISTANCE_NOISE).dtype)
```

::::
:::::

In C++, one has to refer to the pixel format correspondence defined below:

```
FORMAT_8U = 0,
FORMAT_8S = 1,
