# Configuring ifm3d for deployment

The ifm3d API is designed as a software package to be used for development purposes as well as to be deployment ready.

For testing purposes our recommendation is to use the supplied API (C++ and Python) as documented in the examples section.
For deployment purposes the same API can be used, but the user is required to follow certain process to ensure robustness during runtime on embedded systems / IPCs.
