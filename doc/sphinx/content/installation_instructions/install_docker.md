## Docker dev containers
Development containers are available. They are built nightly with the latest version of ifm3d available on the {{ ifm3d_main_branch }} branch. You can pull them using the following command:
```
$ docker pull ghcr.io/ifm/ifm3d:latest
```

For more detailed documentation on using docker containers with the O3R platform, you can refer to [this section](documentation/docker/README:Docker%20on%20O3R).
