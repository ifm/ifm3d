ifm3d - Command Line Tool
=========================

`ifm3d` ships with a command line tool of the same name. The `ifm3d` command
line tool is used to both introspect the state of a camera as well as mutate
parameters. To carry out a particular task, you envoke one of the `ifm3d`
*subcommands*. To get a listing of available subcommands, you can pass the
`--help` option.

```
$ ifm3d --help
ifm3d: version=0.9.0
usage: ifm3d [<global options>] <command> [<args>]

global options:
  -h [ --help ]            Produce this help message and exit
  --ip arg (=192.168.0.69) IP address of the sensor
  --xmlrpc-port arg (=80)  XMLRPC port of the sensor
  --password arg           Password for establishing an edit-session with the
                           sensor


These are common commands used in various situations:

    cp          Create a new application on the sensor,
                bootstrapped from a copy of an existing one.

    config      Configure sensor settings from a JSON description of
                the desired sensor state. See also `dump'.

    dump        Serialize the sensor state to JSON.

    export      Export an application or whole sensor configuration
                into a format compatible with ifm Vision Assistant.

    hz          Compute the actual frequency at which the FrameGrabber
                is running.

    import      Import an application or whole sensor configuration
                that is compatible with ifm Vision Assistant's export
                format.

    ls          Lists the applications currently installed on
                the sensor.

    reboot      Reboot the sensor, potentially into recovery
                mode. Recovery mode is useful for putting the
                sensor into a state where it can be flashed
                with new firmware.

    reset       Reset the sensor to factory defaults.

    rm          Deletes an application from the sensor.

    schema      Construct and analyze image acquisition schema masks.

    swupdate    Perform a firmware update on the camera. Please ensure
                that the camera is booted to recovery beforehand.

    time        Get/set the current time on the camera.

    trace       Get trace messages from the internal camera trace buffer.

As it is reported in the help output above, the `ifm3d` command line program
accepts 1) a set of *global arguments* which control the particular camera you
wish to communicate with; 2) a subcommand; and 3) arguments to the
subcommand. To get a listing of the particular arguments accepted by a
subcommand, you can pass the `--help` option to the subcommand. For exemplary
purposes, let's list the options accepted by the `cp` subcommand.

```
$ ifm3d cp --help
usage: ifm3d [<global options>] cp [<cp options>]

global options:
  -h [ --help ]            Produce this help message and exit
  --ip arg (=192.168.0.69) IP address of the sensor
  --xmlrpc-port arg (=80)  XMLRPC port of the sensor
  --password arg           Password for establishing an edit-session with the
                           sensor

cp options:
  --index arg (=-1)     Index of source application to copy
```

As is shown above, `cp` takes a source application index to copy from.

We now walk through a couple of simple examples of using `ifm3d`. This is not an
exhaustive tutorial on `ifm3d` but rather intended to give a sense of how to
use the tool. The concepts apply broadly to all of the subcommands.

Example: Creating new applications
----------------------------------

Let's first list the applications on the camera.

```
$ ifm3d ls
[
  {
    "Active": true,
    "Description": "",
    "Id": 476707713,
    "Index": 1,
    "Name": "Sample Application"
  }
]
```

Now, let's create a new application whose settings will be bootstrapped from
the application at index `1`.

```
$ ifm3d cp --index=1
$ ifm3d ls
[
  {
    "Active": true,
    "Description": "",
    "Id": 476707713,
    "Index": 1,
    "Name": "Sample Application"
  },
  {
    "Active": false,
    "Description": "",
    "Id": 476707714,
    "Index": 2,
    "Name": "Sample Application"
  }
]
```

Now, let's create a new application from scratch (bootstrapped with
camera-default settings).

```
$ echo '{"Apps":[{}]}' | ifm3d config
$ ifm3d ls
[
  {
    "Active": true,
    "Description": "",
    "Id": 476707713,
    "Index": 1,
    "Name": "Sample Application"
  },
  {
    "Active": false,
    "Description": "",
    "Id": 476707714,
    "Index": 2,
    "Name": "Sample Application"
  },
  {
    "Active": false,
    "Description": "",
    "Id": 1755226334,
    "Index": 3,
    "Name": "New application"
  }
]
```

Now, let's set the application at index `3` to be the current active
application.

```
$ ifm3d dump | jq '.ifm3d.Device.ActiveApplication="3"' | ifm3d config
$ $ ifm3d ls
[
  {
    "Active": false,
    "Description": "",
    "Id": 476707713,
    "Index": 1,
    "Name": "Sample Application"
  },
  {
    "Active": false,
    "Description": "",
    "Id": 476707714,
    "Index": 2,
    "Name": "Sample Application"
  },
  {
    "Active": true,
    "Description": "",
    "Id": 1755226334,
    "Index": 3,
    "Name": "New application"
  }
]
```

Now, let's delete applications `2` and `3`.

```
$ ifm3d rm --index=2
$ ifm3d rm --index=3
$ ifm3d ls
[
  {
    "Active": false,
    "Description": "",
    "Id": 476707713,
    "Index": 1,
    "Name": "Sample Application"
  }
]
```

We note that based on the sequence of steps we took in this example, we are
currently left with a camera with only a single application but it is not
marked as active. So, let's set that application as "active" and validate it.

```
$ ifm3d dump | jq '.ifm3d.Device.ActiveApplication="1"' | ifm3d config
$ ifm3d ls
[
  {
    "Active": true,
    "Description": "",
    "Id": 476707713,
    "Index": 1,
    "Name": "Sample Application"
  }
]
```

Example: Setting the time on the camera
---------------------------------------

To set the time on the camera we use the `time` subcommand. Let's look at its
usage.

```
$ ifm3d time --help
usage: ifm3d [<global options>] time [<time options>]

global options:
  -h [ --help ]            Produce this help message and exit
  --ip arg (=192.168.0.69) IP address of the sensor
  --xmlrpc-port arg (=80)  XMLRPC port of the sensor
  --password arg           Password for establishing an edit-session with the
                           sensor

time options:
  --epoch arg           Secs since Unix epoch encoding time to be set on camera
                        (-1 == now)
```

To simply see the current time on the camera, we can issue the `time`
subcommand with no arguments.

```
$ ifm3d time
Local time on camera is: Tue Mar 13 18:22:16 2018
```

Let's now look at our local Unix time:

```
$ date
Mon May  7 16:20:49 EDT 2018
```

To synchronize the camera to our local time we can issue the following command.

```
$ ifm3d time --epoch=-1
Local time on camera is: Mon May  7 16:21:44 2018
```

And, double checking...

```
$ ifm3d time
Local time on camera is: Mon May  7 16:22:09 2018
```
