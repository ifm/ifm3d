  /**
   * The ByteBuffer class is used to hold a validated byte buffer from the

   * the current schema mask set on the active framegrabber.
   *
   * The ByteBuffer imposes no specific image or point cloud data
   * structure. This class is intended to be subclassed where more user-friendly
   * data structures can be used to gain access to the bytes in a semantically
   * meaningful manner.
   *
   * There are two primary interfaces (documented below) that image container
   * developers should implement. They are:
   *
   * ``ImCreate``
   * ``CloudCreate``
   *
   * These functions will be called as customization hooks at the time of
   * parsing the raw image bytes from the sensor. It is the contract of this
   * interface that all calls to ``ImCreate`` will be made before the single
   * call to ``CloudCreate``. The reason for this part of the contract is to
   * give all image container implementers the ability to set the point cloud
   * intensity data from one of the image containers. That is, at the
   * time of calling ``CloudCreate`` all image data (e.g., amplitude or gray)
   * data are avaialble for coloring the point cloud intensity pixels. In
   * addition, it is guaranteed that the first call to ``ImCreate`` will be the
   * confidence image. So, the confidence bits for a given pixel can be
   * consulting while constructing the payload images.
   *
   * We note that the ploymorphic behaviors implemented by this class are
   * static (resolved at compile-time via CRTP) rather than dynamic at runtime
   * (via a vtable). This is why there are no interface functions declared
   * `virtual`.
